        <title>Achieving Over 10× Faster Sample Generation with conditional DDPM</title>
        <description>We present a unified denoising-diffusion framework for BraTS 2025 Task 8 (synthesizing missing MRI modalities) and Task 9 (inpainting pathology-free regions), with a fast inference strategy over 10× quicker than our BraTS 2024 solution while keeping low computational cost. Results — Task 8: Dice 0.86, SSIM 0.77; Task 9: RMSE 0.053, PSNR 26.77, SSIM 0.918. Code to be released soon.</description>

        <description>Our study demonstrates a practical and powerful way to predict outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC). While low muscle mass is a known risk factor, it's typically measured at the L3 vertebra, which is missed in HNC scans. Using a deep learning analysis of 904 patients, we validate that measurements at the C3 vertebra—an area already included in routine scans—are highly prognostic. We found that both low muscle quantity (SMA) and low muscle quality (SMRA) at C3 independently correlate with worse locoregional control and overall survival, establishing C3 muscle metrics as a critical, accessible new biomarker for HNC.</description>

        <description>We present a brain tumor MRI dataset with 23,049 samples, each including FLAIR, T1, T1ce, and T2 scans, plus one or two segmentation masks. The dataset expands 438 original BraTS 2022 cases through registration, generating additional samples with varied tumor locations. Despite heterogeneous imaging protocols, it provides ground truth for each sample, supporting the development of deep learning–based automated tumor segmentation on unseen cases.</description>

        <description>We evaluated 20 state-of-the-art mandibular segmentation models on 19,218 segmentations from 1,000 multicenter CT/CBCT scans and found accuracy can vary by up to 25% due to factors like voxel size, bone orientation, and patient conditions. While smaller isotropic voxels and neutral orientation improved performance, metallic osteosynthesis and complex anatomy degraded it. These results highlight that AI models are not “plug-and-play” and provide evidence-based recommendations to improve clinical integration.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[We present our winning Task 1 and third-place Task 3 solutions for BraTS, using synthetic data to train SOTA segmentation pipelines—improving robustness for post-treatment glioma segmentation though the pipeline was less suited to meningioma. Results — Task 1 (ET, NETC, RC, SNFH, TC, WT): DSC = 0.790, 0.808, 0.776, 0.893, 0.787, 0.894; HD95 = 35.63, 30.35, 44.58, 16.87, 38.19, 17.95. Task 3 (test): DSC = 0.801, HD95 = 38.26.

        <description>We trained a ResNet50 model on 26,956 cropped teeth images from panoramic radiographs to predict whether a tooth should be extracted or preserved. The AI achieved ROC-AUC = 0.901 and PR-AUC = 0.749, outperforming dentists (ROC-AUC = 0.797, PR-AUC = 0.589). These results show that AI can support clinical decision-making by improving accuracy and reducing errors in tooth extraction indications.</description>
